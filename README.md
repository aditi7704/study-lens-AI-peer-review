# 🧠 StudyLens – AI Peer Review Circle

> A decentralized AI-powered platform where students peer-review each other's answers, projects, and resumes, while AI evaluates the reviewers themselves for fairness, depth, and helpfulness.

---

**StudyLens** is an innovative peer review system where learning becomes collaborative and intelligent. Unlike typical "AI-only" checkers, StudyLens introduces a **Student vs Student + AI** model — enabling a gamified, trust-based learning loop powered by human insight and AI validation.
